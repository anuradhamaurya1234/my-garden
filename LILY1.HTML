<H1>Lilies are a genus of flowering plants that grow from bulbs12.
 They are usually quite tall and are perennials1.
 Lilies have six plain or strikingly marked tepals 
 (“petals”) and are often trumpet-shaped, sitting atop a tall,
 erect stem with narrow, long, lance-shaped leaves3. 
 The flowers consist of six petal-like segments, 
 which may form the shape of a trumpet, with a more or less elongated tube4.
 Lilies come in many beautiful colors, including pink, gold, red, orange, and white.</H1>
